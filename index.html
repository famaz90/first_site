    <p>
      I am a professor at Cornell University. My research focuses on the
      interaction of algorithms and networks, and the roles they play in
      large-scale social and information systems. My work has been supported by
      an NSF Career Award, an ONR Young Investigator Award, a MacArthur
      Foundation Fellowship, a Packard Foundation Fellowship, a Simons
      Investigator Award, a Sloan Foundation Fellowship, a Vannevar Bush Faculty
      Fellowship, and grants from Facebook, Google, Yahoo, the MacArthur
      Foundation, the ARO, and the NSF. I am a member of the National Academy of
      Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Academy of
      Arts and Sciences.
